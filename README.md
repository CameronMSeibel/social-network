# Social Network API
	
## Description

The social network API is a back-end service that will allow users to add and remove friends, create and delete posts, read posts from friends, and update their own posts. Users can react to posts from their friends. It is built on node JS with express and MongoDB with mongoose. Check out a video walkthrough on this app [here](https://youtu.be/ine2ydbW_Ms).
